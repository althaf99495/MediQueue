## Initial Setup

### Creating the First Admin Account

**Option 1: Using the Web Interface (Recommended)**
1. Start the application
2. Visit `/setup` in your browser
3. Fill in the admin details (name, email, password)
4. Submit the form
5. Log in with your new admin account

**Option 2: Using Environment Variables**
Set the following environment variables before starting the app:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin email address
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin password (minimum 8 characters)

The admin account will be created automatically on first run.

**Security Note**: The `/setup` route is only accessible when no admin accounts exist. Once an admin is created, the route redirects to the home page.

## Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Flask session secret key
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection URL (defaults to localhost:6379)

## Development Notes
- The application runs on port 5000 with SocketIO/eventlet
- Database tables are auto-created on first run
- Default admin account is created automatically
- Redis queue service has fallback handling for offline development

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- SMS/Email notifications for appointment reminders
- Public lobby display for queue status
- Patient feedback forms after visits
- Advanced analytics with exportable reports
- Multilingual support
- API endpoints for mobile app integration
