Perfect — you’re building **MediQueue** as a *smart, modern hospital queue management system* — **realistic**, not gimmicky, and ready for real-world use.

Below is your finalized **feature list** — all the best ideas except the AI/symptom triage part — organized clearly by user type and functionality.
Everything here can be implemented cleanly with Flask + Redis + Bootstrap + PostgreSQL.

## 🏥 **MediQueue – Full Feature Blueprint**

### 🌐 **Core System Overview**

MediQueue is a hospital queue and appointment management platform that:

* Digitizes patient-doctor interactions.
* Reduces waiting times.
* Offers real-time updates and transparent queue logic.
* Includes role-based access for Admin, Doctor, and Patient.

---

## 🔐 **Authentication & Roles**

* Role-based login system (Admin, Doctor, Patient)
* Session-based authentication (Flask-Login)
* Registration for patients
* Admin-only account creation for doctors
* Password hashing + secure logout

---

## 👨‍⚕️ **Doctor Features**

* Dashboard showing live queue for assigned patients
* View patient info and medical history
* Mark patient as *consulted* → auto dequeue
* Write and download **digital prescriptions (PDF)**
* Access patient visit history
* Set working hours and **availability calendar**
* View personal queue analytics (patients served, avg consult time)

---

## 👩‍💼 **Patient Features**

* Register / Login
* **Book appointments** (choose doctor, department, time)
* Or **walk-in queue join** for immediate service
* View **current queue position** and **estimated wait time**
* **Receive live notifications** when nearing their turn (WebSocket or polling)
* View and download **prescriptions** and **visit history**
* Option to **cancel appointments** or reschedule
* QR-based check-in at hospital kiosk/tablet

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Admin Features**

* Admin dashboard with:

  * Queue stats (per doctor, per department)
  * Total patients served today
  * Active queues
* CRUD management for:

  * Doctors
  * Patients
  * Departments
* Manage doctor schedules and time slots
* Manually **prioritize** or **reorder** queue items (e.g., emergency or senior patients)
* System health panel (Redis, DB, queue status)
* Role-based access logs (who changed what)

---

## 🧮 **Queue System (Redis-Powered)**

* Central **Redis queue service** for high-speed operations
* Functions:

  * `enqueue(patient_id, doctor_id)`
  * `dequeue(doctor_id)`
  * `get_position(patient_id)`
  * `get_queue(doctor_id)`
  * `reorder_queue(doctor_id, new_order)`
* Department-based queue separation
* **Priority queue support** for emergencies or elderly patients
* **Real-time notifications** using Flask-SocketIO
* Works offline with fallback (mock Redis for local testing)

---

## 🩺 **Medical Record Management (Mini EHR)**

* Store minimal patient history per visit:

  * Symptoms, diagnosis, prescription, date
* Doctors can access past records
* Patients can download their visit summary as PDF

---

## 🗓️ **Appointment Management**

* **Two modes**:

  1. Pre-scheduled appointments
  2. Walk-in queue registration
* Auto-assigns patient to appropriate department and doctor
* Prevents double booking based on doctor availability
* Appointment reminders via email or SMS (optional extension)

---

## 🕒 **Smart Queue Features**

* **Estimated Wait Time (EWT)** based on:

  * Average consultation duration per doctor
  * Queue length
* Updates dynamically as doctors mark patients complete
* **Live queue display** on public screen (hospital lobby mode)

---

## 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**

* Charts and metrics:

  * Average waiting time per doctor
  * Department load (patients/hour)
  * Total patients served per day/week
  * Appointment vs. walk-in ratio
* Export analytics as CSV or PDF
* Built using Chart.js or Recharts

---

## 📱 **User Experience Enhancements**

* Responsive Bootstrap 5 UI (clean medical theme)
* Navigation bar with role-specific menus
* Toast notifications for queue updates
* QR check-in system for on-site patients
* Kiosk-friendly registration screen
* Loading and transition animations (calm & modern)

---

## ⚙️ **System & Technical Features**

* Redis + Flask integration
* PostgreSQL / SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
* Configurable environment via `.env`
* Dockerized app with `docker-compose.yml`:

  * Flask app
  * Redis service
  * PostgreSQL DB
* Unit + Integration tests with Pytest
* Coverage ≥ 85%
* Mocked Redis for test environments
* CI-ready (GitHub Actions optional)

---

## 🧾 **Security & Logging**

* CSRF protection (Flask-WTF)
* Secure password storage with hashing
* Session timeout configuration
* Access audit logs (admin actions, login attempts)
* Configurable logging levels (info/debug/error)

---

## 🏗️ **Bonus (Optional Extensions)**

These can be added later if you want to impress or scale up:

* SMS/Email queue alerts using Celery + Twilio/SMTP
* Multilingual interface (English, Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
* Patient feedback forms per visit
* Night mode toggle (dark/light UI)
* API endpoints for mobile app integration
